# Rails learning

This project is my attempt to learn Ruby on Rails. I have mostly been following the tutorial [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

## Documentation / resources

## Backlog
  * Deploy to Heroku
  * Add CI to repo
  * Add tests / make tests pass
  * Remove stuff that isn't relevant (e.g. Mailer stuff ??)
  * Put validation on comment posting
  * Some kind of authorization
  * Document how this all hangs together
  * What's the expected way of passing data into a partial?
  * How do forms know where to POST their data to?
  * Add JSON views
  * Edit comments
